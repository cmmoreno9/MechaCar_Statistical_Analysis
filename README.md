# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Deliverable 1 
. The vehicle ground clearance and length exhibit randome amounts of variance. Thus they have a signigicant effect on the MGP of the MechaCar. 
. Slope is not considered to be 0. This is due to the fact that the p-value is smaller than .05 significance. Thus the null hypothesis is not true. 
. The linear model does effectively precict the mgp of MechaCar prototypes. r-square = 0.7149, so there is about a 71.5% probability that the future data      will fit the model.
